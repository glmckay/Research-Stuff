# Research-Stuff
A collection of programs I wrote during my time time in graduate school. This is intended to be an easy link I can give, in case someone requests it.

[thesis-verification](thesis-verification/) contains programs which are referred to in my thesis.

[graph-utilities](graph-utilities/) contains a couple small tools I wrote to work with graphs.

[other-stuff](other-stuff/) contains any other miscellaneous stuff I felt was worth posting.
